# Hints for using memo

See `../README.md` for how to install typst and then to install templates,
assuming a macOS machine.  (Consult the web for use on other machines.)

To speed the learning process, examine the `sample.typ` file. If you run this
file using

```sh
typst compile sample.typ
```

you ought to get as you see here, in the `sample.pdf` file.

Note that there is also a typst app, but I've not tried using that, because I
prefer editing files in my favourite text editor, and I like using the unix
command-line interface.
